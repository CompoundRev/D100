                    <p class="text-base md:text-lg opacity-90">I see you. I've worked with hundreds of patients who felt exactly the way you do right now; tired of planning meals around what you can actually chew, exhausted from years of temporary fixes that never quite work, frustrated by the constant worry about whether your dentures will slip at the worst possible moment. Maybe you've been thinking about implants for months, or even years, but the fear of surgery or the overwhelm of making the right choice kept you stuck.</p>
                    <p class="text-base md:text-lg opacity-90">Here's what I want you to know: this decision doesn't have to feel scary or complicated. All-on-4 implants have transformed the lives of my patients, not just their smiles, but their entire sense of confidence and freedom. I've seen people cry tears of joy when they bite into an apple for the first time in a decade. I've watched patients light up when they realize they can laugh without covering their mouth. This is what we do, and we do it with the kind of care and precision that comes from over 30 years of dedication to this work.</p>
                    <p class="text-base md:text-lg opacity-90">You deserve to feel like yourself again. Let's talk about how we can make that happen together. Your consultation is the first step, and I promise you'll leave feeling hopeful, informed, and ready to move forward.</p>
