                        These aren't temporary dentures or bridges that need constant adjustment. All-on-4 implants are anchored directly into your jawbone, stimulating bone growth and preventing the deterioration that happens with traditional dentures. This is a long-term investment in your health and confidence.

                        I see you. I've worked with hundreds of patients who felt exactly the way you do right now; exhausted from years of dental problems, hesitant after previous disappointments, wondering if this is really the answer you've been searching for.

I've watched them bite into an apple at their follow-up appointment with pure joy on their faces.

                            The implant surgery itself typically takes 2-3 hours per arch. You'll receive a temporary set of teeth the same day, allowing you to leave with a complete smile. Your permanent prosthetic is placed after initial healing, usually within a few months.

                            Absolutely not. One of the biggest advantages of All-on-4 is that you receive a functional set of temporary teeth on the same day as your surgery. You'll never be without teeth.

                            In most cases, yes. The angled placement of All-on-4 implants maximizes existing bone and often eliminates the need for bone grafting. A 3D scan during your consultation will determine if you're a candidate.

                            Most patients report that recovery is far more comfortable than they expected. You'll receive detailed post-op care instructions and medication to manage any discomfort. Many patients return to work within a few days and are eating normally within weeks.

                            You'll stick to soft foods for the first few weeks while your implants integrate with the bone. After full healing, you can eat virtually anything—steak, apples, corn on the cob—without restrictions.

                            With proper care, All-on-4 implants can last 20+ years or even a lifetime. The implants themselves integrate permanently with your jawbone. The prosthetic teeth may need minor adjustments over time but are built for long-term durability.
