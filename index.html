                    <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">Dr. Bodah didn't just choose dentistry as a career. He chose it as a calling. After completing his Doctor of Dental Surgery at the University of Buffalo School of Dental Medicine and a rigorous post-graduate residency at Upstate Medical University, he specialized in advanced cosmetic and restorative dentistry through The Nash Institute. But credentials only tell part of the story.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">What truly sets Dr. Bodah apart is his relentless commitment to learning and precision. With over 400 hours of continuing education in just the last two years, he stays at the absolute forefront of implant technology and techniques. He's traveled to Senegal, Africa, to provide care to those who would otherwise never receive it, an experience that deepened his understanding of what it means to restore not just teeth, but dignity and hope.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700">Now calling Wilmington home, Dr. Bodah combines technical mastery with genuine compassion. He knows that every patient sitting in his chair has a story, years of frustration, embarrassment, and longing for a solution that finally works. His mission is simple: to give you back the smile you thought you'd lost forever, using the most advanced methods available, and to make sure you feel seen, heard, and cared for every step of the way.</p>

                    <p>I see you.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've worked with hundreds of patients who felt exactly the way you do right now. Maybe you've been thinking about this for months, or even years. Maybe you've scrolled through before-and-after photos late at night, wondering if it's really possible for you. Maybe you're tired of planning your life around what you can and can't eat, or avoiding photos because you don't want anyone to see.</p>
                    
                    <p>I want you to know something: you're not alone, and this isn't your fault.</p>
                    
                    <p>What I've learned in my years of practice is that the people who walk through our doors aren't looking for perfection. They're looking for freedom. Freedom to laugh without covering their mouth. Freedom to eat what they want. Freedom to stop thinking about their teeth every single day.</p>
                    
                    <p>That's what we do here. We don't just place implants—we give people their lives back. And we do it with honesty, compassion, and the most advanced technology available.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you're ready to stop waiting and start living, I'd be honored to meet you. Let's talk about what's possible.</p>
