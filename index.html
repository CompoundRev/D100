                        I see you. I've sat across from hundreds of patients who felt exactly what you're feeling right now, the frustration of looking tired when you feel vibrant, the self-consciousness in photos, the awareness that non-surgical treatments just aren't delivering anymore.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-100 leading-relaxed">
                        You've probably been thinking about this for months, maybe years. You've scrolled through before-and-after photos late at night, wondering if the results could really be that natural. You've worried about looking "done," about recovery time, about making the wrong choice.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-100 leading-relaxed">
                        Here's what I want you to know: those concerns are valid, and they're exactly why choosing the right surgeon matters so much.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-100 leading-relaxed">
                        My commitment to you is simple. I will listen to your concerns without judgment. I will design a surgical plan tailored specifically to your facial structure and aesthetic goals. I will use proven techniques that deliver natural, lasting results. And I will be honest about what's achievable and what's not.
                    </p>

                        Facial rejuvenation isn't about changing who you are. It's about revealing the vibrant, confident version of yourself that's been there all along - just hidden by years of gravity, sun exposure, and time.
                    </p>

                            A well-executed facelift typically lasts 10-15 years. While you'll continue to age naturally, you'll maintain a more youthful baseline than if you hadn't had the procedure. Many patients say they still look better a decade later than they did before surgery.

                            You'll be under anesthesia during surgery and feel no pain. Post-operatively, discomfort is typically mild and well-managed with prescribed medication. Most patients describe it as tightness rather than pain.

                            The best candidates are in good general health, have realistic expectations, and are bothered by visible signs of facial aging that non-surgical treatments can't adequately address. Your consultation will determine candidacy and discuss what's achievable for your unique situation.
